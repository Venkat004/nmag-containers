# nmag-containers

Towards compilation of Nmag in containers, and subsequent use from inside the
container.

Only the ubuntu 12.04 singularity container works.

[The other images in `archive` do not work yet. From memory: seems to compile,
but "nsim" doesn't show a python prompt and/or tests fail.]
